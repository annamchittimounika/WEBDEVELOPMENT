# WEBDEVELOPMENT
Day 1 of My HTML Learning Journey!
 Today, I took my first step into the world of Web Development by learning the basics of HTML.
ðŸ“– What I learned:
HTML structure: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>
Headings: <h1> to <h6>
Paragraphs: <p>
Line breaks: <br>, horizontal lines: <hr>
Comments: <!-- This is a comment -->
ðŸ’» Mini Project:
Used <h1>, <h2>, <h3> tags for structured headings
âœ… Added a paragraph section describing my education, skills, project, internships, and career objective
âœ… Highlighted important technologies and project name using bold text
âœ… Added a horizontal line (<hr>) to separate sections visually
âœ… Used line breaks (<br>) and checkmark symbols (âœ”) to make project tasks and tools readable
