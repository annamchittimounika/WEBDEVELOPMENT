# 🌐 Day 1: My HTML Learning Journey

Today, I began my journey into Web Development by learning the fundamentals of HTML!

## 📖 What I Learned
- Basic HTML structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- Paragraphs: `<p>`
- Line breaks: `<br>`, Horizontal lines: `<hr>`
- Comments: `<!-- This is a comment -->`

## 💻 Mini Project

### ✅ Features Implemented:
- Used `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` tags for clear and structured headings
- Added a paragraph section describing:
  - 🎓 Education  
  - 💡 Skills  
  - 📁 Project  
  - 🧑‍💼 Internships  
  - 🎯 Career Objective
- Highlighted **important technologies** and **project name** using `<b>` (bold)
- Visually separated content sections using `<hr>`
- Applied `<br>` and ✔ symbols to enhance readability
